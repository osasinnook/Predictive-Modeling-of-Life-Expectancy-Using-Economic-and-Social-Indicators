### Project Title:
**"Predictive Modeling of Life Expectancy Using Economic and Social Indicators"**

### Introduction:
In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate life expectancy based on various economic and social factors. The dataset includes the following features:
- **GDP:** Gross Domestic Product
- **Percentage Expenditure:** Percentage of expenditure
- **Total Expenditure:** Total expenditure
- **Income Composition of Resources:** A measure of the income composition of resources
- **Schooling:** Average years of schooling
- **Life Expectancy:** Target variable representing the life expectancy in years

### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling.
   - Applied transformations to normalize the data distribution.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Calculated correlations between features and the target variable.
   - Identified key predictors of life expectancy.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Trained a predictive model using selected features.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using key metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).
   - Assessed model robustness and generalizability using cross-validation R² scores.

5. **Feature Importance:**
   - Analyzed the impact of each feature on the model's predictions.

### Results:
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - GDP, percentage expenditure, total expenditure, income composition of resources, and schooling were significant predictors of life expectancy.
- **Model Performance:**
  - MSE: 0.02
  - MAE: 0.08
  - RMSE: 0.13
  - R-squared (R²): 0.81
  - Cross-Validation R² Scores: [0.714, 0.766, 0.767, 0.614, 0.583]
  - Mean Cross-Validation R² Score: 0.689

### Conclusion:
The predictive model demonstrated high accuracy and generalizability, effectively estimating life expectancy based on economic and social indicators. The strong correlations and high R² scores highlight the importance of these features in understanding life expectancy variations.
